# Disciple Tools - Facebook

Integrate your Facebook pages with Disciple Tools and allow the online conversation to continue offline.

## Purpose
Teams using Facebook or ManyChat to connect with people for spiritual conversations and who want to
ultimately bring that conversation out of Facebook for personal follow-up will want to use this plugin.

This plugin will create a contact record in Disciple.Tools whenever someone messages your Facebook Pages(s).
You will still continue your conversation with the seeker using Facebook or another tool like Manychat, but the
conversation and individual is recorded and ready for follow-up once the person is ready to take the social
risk of meeting.

## Usage

#### Will do:

- Automatically create a contact in D.T when a conversation is started on you Facebook Page.
- Copies all messages received and sent as comments on the contact record.
- Creates a link an the D.T contact record navigating to the conversation in you page's messages inbox.

#### Will not do:
- Does not create a link on the Facebook conversation to the D.T contact.
- Does not create a link to the contact's Facebook profile.
- Does not let you send messages to the contact directly from D.T.
- Does not sync posts.
- Does not sync comments made on your posts.
- Does not sync labels or notes saved on the Facebook Conversation.
- Does not talk to the contact for you (sigh).

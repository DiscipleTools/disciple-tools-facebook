# Disciple Tools Facebook Plugin
Integration between Disciple.Tools and Facebook pages.

## Purpose
Create a contact record in Disciple.Tools when someone messages your Facebook Pages(s).

Here is what this plugin does:
- Automatically create a contact in D.T when a conversation is started on you Facebook Page.
- Copies all messages received and sent as comments on the contact record.
- Creates a link an the D.T contact record navigating to the conversation in you page's messages inbox.

Does not do:
- Does not create a link on the Facebook conversation to the D.T contact.
- Does not create a link to the contact's Facebook profile.
- Does not sync posts.
- Does not sync comments made on your posts.
- Does not sync labels or notes saved on the Facebook Conversation.
- Does not talk to the contact for you (sigh).

What you need:
- A facebook page
- Facebook Business Manager
- A Disciple.Tools intance
